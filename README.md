# NewshoreAirApp Backend

In this solution, it is proposed to create a system to connect trips around the world, using clean architecture, CQRS and design patterns.

In this application we have implemented the multiple routes level where the user can enter a place of origin, a place of destination and a limit of stopovers in his trip. The application will take care of calculating the route and the stopovers that your trip will have as well as its total price.
