# NewshoreAirApp Backend

In this solution, it is proposed to create a system to connect trips around the world, using clean architecture, CQRS and design patterns.

In this application we have implemented the multiple routes level where the user can enter a place of origin, a place of destination and a limit of stopovers in his trip. The application will take care of calculating the route and the stopovers that your trip will have as well as its total price.

## Project execution

To run the project, clone the repository or download the files, go to the NewshoreAir.API folder where the NewshoreAir.Application.csproj file is located and execute the command [dotnet run] or if it is not located in the specified path you can execute the command [dotnet run --project (path of the .csproj file)].
